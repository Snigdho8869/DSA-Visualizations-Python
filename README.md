# DSA Visualizations and Games in Python

This repository contains a collection of Python projects designed to visualize and interactively demonstrate various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts through simple games and applications.

## Purpose

The goal of this collection is to provide a hands-on way to understand how different DSA concepts work in practice. Instead of just reading theory, you can run these scripts to see algorithms in action.

## Algorithms & Data Structures Covered

The projects are organized into folders based on the primary DSA concept they illustrate:

*   **Arrays_Lists:**
    *   `memory_match.py`: Simple card matching game (uses lists).
    *   `snake.py`: Classic Snake game (uses lists for snake body).
    *   `tic-toe.py`: Tic-Tac-Toe game (uses 2D list/array for the board).
*   **Backtracking:**
    *   `sudoku_solver.py`: Solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking.
*   **Bit_Manipulation:**
    *   `bitwise.py`: Simple quiz game for bitwise operations.
*   **Disjoint_Sets:**
    *   `disjoint_sets.py`: Game demonstrating connected components using Union-Find.
*   **Divide_Conquer:**
    *   `treasure_hunt.py`: Treasure hunt game with hints (similar logic to binary search).
*   **Dynamic_Programming:**
    *   `dynamic_programming.py`: GUI application solving various DP problems (Coin Change, Knapsack, LCS, etc.).
*   **Graphs:**
    *   `city_navigation.py`: Finds shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    *   `maze.py`: Maze solver visualization using Bellman-Ford.
    *   `maze2.py`/`maze4.py`: Maze solver visualization using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    *   `maze3.py`: Maze solver visualization using Depth-First Search (DFS).
    *   `social_network.py`: Simple social network simulator and analysis using undirected graph.
    *   `tower.py`: Tower defense game using A* pathfinding.
*   **Greedy_Algorithms:**
    *   `greedy_algorithms.py`: GUI application solving various greedy problems (Fractional Knapsack, Activity Selection, etc.).
*   **Hash_Tables:**
    *   `inventory.py`: Player inventory system using dictionaries.
*   **Heaps:**
    *   `leaadderr.py`: Game leaderboard implementation using `heapq`.
    *   `tetris.py`: Tetris game using `heapq` for piece generation priority.
*   **Linked_Lists:**
    *   `treasure.py`: Treasure hunt game using a linked list for clues.
*   **Queue:**
    *   `maze.py`: Maze game using queue.
*   **Recursion_Backtracking:**
    *   `maze_generation.py`: Generates mazes using recursive backtracking.
*   **Sorting:**
    *   `sorting_visualizer.py`: Visualizes various sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge).
*   **Stacks:**
    *   `tower_of_honoi.py`: Classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle solver.
*   **Trees:**
    *   `battle.py`: Simple AI decision-making using a Decision Tree (Scikit-learn).
    *   `binary_tree.py`: Interactive Binary Search Tree explorer.
    *   `fenwick_forrest.py`: Game demonstrating Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees).
    *   `leaderboard.py`: Game leaderboard using a Segment Tree for range queries.
    *   `word_autocomplete.py`: Word auto-completion using a Trie.
